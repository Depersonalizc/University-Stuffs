## Binary Search Trees

### Problem 1

```pseudocode
INSERT-NODE(node, z)
	/* z: a node with key to insert,
     *    z.left == z.right == NIL,
     *    assuming no repeated keys */
	if node == NIL
		return z
	if z.key < node.key
		node.left = INSERT-NODE(node.left, z)
	else
		node.right = INSERT-NODE(node.right, z)

TREE-INSERT(T, z)
	T.root = INSERT-NODE(T.root, z)
```

### Problem 2

The inorder tree walk visits each node exactly once and at each visit does only constant work (printing the node). Hence the walk takes $\Theta(n)$ time. The total running time is then given by
$$
T(n)=\sum_{i=1}^n\Theta(c_i)+\Theta(n)
$$
where $c_i$ is the number of comparisons made at $i$-th insertion.

The worst case is a tree skewed to the far-left or far-right in a straight chain. For example, if we insert integers $1$ to $n$ in the ascending order, at $i$-th insertion we have to compare key $i$ with every node in the tree before ending up at the bottom-right. In this case we have that $c_i=i-1,$ and so
$$
T(n)=\Theta\left(\sum_{i=1}^ni\right)+\Theta(n)=\Theta(n(n+1)/2)=\Theta(n^2)
$$
The best case is when the tree is filled up in a level-by-level fashion, that is, when the sequence $a_1,a_2\cdots a_n$ inserted satisfies
$$
a_{2k}<a_k<a_{2k+1},\quad\forall \text{ valid }k
$$
In this case, the $i$-th insertion requires comparisons of $a_i$ with some element on each non-leaf layer of the tree comprised of $a_1,\cdots a_{i-1}$ (except if $i$ is a power of two, in which case an extra comparison with the first leaf node is required). Therefore the number of comparison made at $i$-th insertion is bounded by
$$
\log i - 1\le c_i\le \log i\implies c_i=\Theta(\log i)
$$
and so the best-case running time is given by
$$
T(n)=\Theta\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\log i\right)+\Theta(n)=\Theta(\log(n!))=\Theta(n\log n)
$$
using Stirling's approximation for factorials.

## Red-Black Trees

### Problem 3

*All NIL nodes (black) under the leaves are omitted from the graphs for clarity.*

### Problem 4

Let $L$ denote the longest path from node $x$ to *some* descendent leaf, and let $l$ denote the shortest such path. We wish to show
$$
|L|\le 2|l|
$$
The property of RB-tree requires the number of black nodes on $L$ and $l$ to be equal, and that no red nodes are consecutive on both paths. Therefore if $x$ is a red node, the longest path $L$ can make is with alternating B-R nodes:
$$
L:x(R)\to \overbrace{B\to R\to\cdots\to B}^{\text{bh}(x)\text{ blacks}}
$$
The shortest path $l$ can make is with all black nodes:
$$
l:x(R)\to \overbrace{B\to B\to\cdots\to B}^{\text{bh}(x)\text{ blacks}}
$$
In this case,
$$
|L|=2\cdot\text{bh}(x)-1\le 2|l|=2\cdot \text{bh}(x)
$$
If $x$ is itself a black node, then the longest path $L$ can make is with alternating R-B nodes:
$$
L:x(B)\to \overbrace{R\to B\to\cdots\to B}^{\text{bh}(x)\text{ blacks}}
$$
while the shortest path $l$ can make remains of the same form (all black). In this case,
$$
|L|=2\cdot\text{bh}(x)\le 2|l|=2\cdot \text{bh}(x)
$$
establishing the desired inequality.

## Graph Algorithms

### Problem 5

```pseudocode
BFS(G, s)
 1  for each vertex u ∈ G.V - {s}
 2  	u.color = WHITE
 3      u.d = ∞
 4      u.π = NIL
 5	/* s.color = GRAY */
 6  s.d = 0
 7  s.π = NIL
 8  Q = ∅
 9  ENQUEUE(Q, s)
10  while Q ≠ ∅
11  	u = DEQUEUE(Q)
12      for each v ∈ G.Adj[u]
13  		if v.color == WHITE
14          	/* v.color = GRAY */
15          	v.d = u.d + 1
16          	v.π = u
17              ENQUEUE(Q, v)
18   	u.color = BLACK
```

We claim that deleting both line 5 and line 14 which assign color `GRAY` to the vertices does not affect the result of the algorithm. Notice that the only place where the control flow of the program could be affected by the color of the vertices is line 13, which checks if `v.color == WHITE`. Thus it suffices to show that `v.color` could not originally be `GRAY` and only becomes `WHITE` on line 13 after deletion of `GRAY` assignments $(*).$

For source `s`, it was `GRAY` starting from line 5 and was colored `BLACK` at the end of first round of the while loop. From there it could never enter line 14 and so it remained `BLACK` since. So `s` was never `GRAY` as vertex `v` on line 13, avoiding $(*).$

For any non-source vertex `u`, is was first colored `GRAY` as a neighboring vertex `v` on line 14 and ceased to be so when it was colored black on line 18 after all of its neighbors had been examined. With line 14 deleted `u` was of the initial color `WHITE` as the neighboring vertex `v` to be enqueued on line 14. However before `u` was colored `BLACK` on 18 again 

### Problem 6

```python
from llist import sllist
class LLStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ll = sllist()

    # len: θ(1)
    def __len__(self):
        return self.ll.size
    
    # push: θ(1)
    def push(self, value):
        # Equivalent to L.LIST-INSERT(L.head) in the book
        return self.ll.appendleft(value)

    # pop: θ(1)
    def pop(self):
        assert len(self) > 0
        # Equivalent to L.LIST-DELETE(L.head) in the book
        return self.ll.popleft()

    # peek: θ(1)
    def peek(self):
        assert len(self) > 0
        return self.ll.first.value
```

### Problem 7

### Problem 8

The recurrence is given by
$$
T(n)=T((1-\alpha)n)+T(\alpha n)+\Theta(n)
$$
with $0\lt \alpha \le 1/2\le 1-\alpha.$

We see that the maximum depth occurs on the leftmost branch
