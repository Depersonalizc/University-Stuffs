Stance: "Multi-Naturalism"

Mixture of

- Naturalist. In the sense that I believe that moral judgments/preferences can be explained by/deduced from natural laws, e.g., psychology. That moral is a natural phenomenon just like we eat, drink, reproduce, urinate. Although it is a highly complex natural phenomenon, it is still within the reach of natural science.
- Expressivist. I agree that moral judgments are a matter of subjective preference. However I do believe, which expressivists might disagree, that the so-called "subjective" states of mind are, in essence, objective, i.e., the result of many sophisticated natural mechanisms.
- "Multi-Realism". Different from a typical naturalist view, I believe the thing moral is not singular, but plural. There is no single MORAL which, say, all laws of nature lead to. But rather, there're different "natures", i.e., varied conditions of individuals [example? psychological condition? growing environment?], and those conditions determine the moral positions of us.

If moral is plural, how do you explain there's some consensus of right/wrong morally?

You explain it yourself: It is a consensus - or - a macro phenomenon when you are in the perspective of human races/societies, rather than individuals. When we form a society, different "natures" of individuals inevitably mix up [example?] to form a greater "nature", the moral most of us perceive and believe. [It is analogous to the interaction of the atoms in a system]
