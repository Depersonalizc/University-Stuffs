1. When someone expresses a conative attitude, (s)he is not merely describing/reporting his/her conative state of mind, but also uses the language to put implicit commands on others - wishing the outside world to change according to his/her will. This is true for moral judgements, for, if all judgements merely report conative attitudes, moral disputes would not be possible. (The only way to attack one's moral judgement would be saying "You didn't think so.")

2. Belief-Desire Theory of Motivation states that one's motivation to do X has two necessary components:

   1. A desire to realize state Y
   2. A belief that doing X will help realize state Y

   Hume's Law states that one cannot derive normative facts ("ought") solely from natural facts ("is")

3. Emotivism says that moral claims may have meaningful/verifiable parts that are truth-apt, but these parts are not related to moral terms. Any content added by moral terms are not verifiable and therefore meaningless. They simply express one's emotion and are not truth-apt.

4. The Frege-Geach Problem says: A moral sentence should have the same meaning when asserted independently and when embedded in a larger sentence in an unassertive manner. Say,

   If torturing is wrong, then torturing prisoners of war is wrong.

   Torturing is wrong

   Therefore, torturing prisoners of war is wrong.

   For the logic to be valid, the two "torturing is wrong" should have the same meaning. However according to Expressivism the second premise has an essential meaning of expressing a conative attitude while the first premise does not.
